# Active Context: JAMStack Website Template

## Current Focus
The current focus is on establishing the core structure and components of the JAMStack website template. We've successfully set up the following:

1. **Project Initialization**: 
   - Next.js project with TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS integration
   - shadcn/ui component library

2. **Core Components**: 
   - Layout components (Header, Footer)
   - Section components (Hero, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, Contact)
   - UI components via shadcn/ui (Button, Card, Avatar, etc.)

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Responsive layouts for all sections
   - Adaptive navigation (hamburger menu on mobile)

## Recent Changes
- Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and App Router
- Integrated shadcn/ui component library
- Created layout components (Header, Footer)
- Implemented landing page sections (Hero, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, Contact)
- Configured responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Added documentation in Memory Bank

## Active Decisions

### Design System Approach
We've decided to use shadcn/ui rather than building custom components from scratch. This provides:
- High-quality, accessible components
- Consistent design language
- Flexibility for customization
- Reduced development time

### Component Organization
Components are organized by function:
- `layout/` for structural components
- `sections/` for content sections
- `ui/` for shadcn UI components

This separation provides clear boundaries and makes it easier to locate and maintain components.

### State Management
For this template, we're using React's built-in state management (useState, useContext) rather than external libraries like Redux. The current complexity does not warrant additional state management solutions, keeping the bundle size smaller and the learning curve gentler.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Documentation**: 
   - Add comprehensive comments to components
   - Create README with setup and customization instructions

2. **Additional Features**:
   - Dark mode toggle
   - Animation and transitions
   - Additional page templates (about, blog, etc.)

3. **Optimization**:
   - Performance testing and optimization
   - SEO improvements
   - Lighthouse score optimization

### Future Considerations
1. **Content Management**:
   - Integration with headless CMS options
   - Dynamic content loading

2. **Authentication**:
   - User authentication templates
   - Protected routes examples

3. **E-commerce**:
   - Product listing components
   - Cart and checkout flow templates

## Current Challenges
- Balancing flexibility for customization with opinionated defaults
- Ensuring accessibility across all components
- Maintaining performance while adding features
- Keeping dependencies minimal while providing rich functionality
